# Password Validation API

This repository contains a password validation API I created for my Subteam on the MSU Solar Racing Team.

## Setup

```
npm install
```

## Websockets and CRUD API
To Run the Websockets and CRUD Server Locally, run 

`npm start`

This will automatically start the websockets server.

**This will be running on PORT 8080**

## Test Endpoints

I have a POSTMAN Collection Added to this Repository. If you want to test the API Calls, Feel free to load the collection and test the calls. 

## Connected the Database

Download MongoDB locally on your computer, and set the environment variable DB_URL, with the url to connect to your database.

## User Backend Validation
This repository will also contain the services for User Validation. This way we can have an extra layer of security for our website, and only allow authorized users to access.

## User Scripts

Run Nodemon Server (AutoUpdating)
```
npm run devStart
```

Run the Auth Server in Base NodeJS
```
npm run auth
```
